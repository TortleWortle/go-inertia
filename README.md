# go-inertia
Go adapter for InertiaJS

## Why
I liked using InertiaJS and I want to use it with Go.

## Goals
1. Understand how InertiaJS works.
2. Having an api to interface with InertiaJS in a way that I can experiment with.

## Credit
This package uses ideas from both [romsar/gonertia](https://github.com/romsar/gonertia) and [petaki/inertia-go](https://github.com/petaki/inertia-go).
